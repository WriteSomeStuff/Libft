# Libft - @Codam
My implementation of some of the Standard C Library functions including some additional ones.
The goal was to create our own standard library so I can use it for other projects at Codam.

## How does it work?

```bash
git clone https://github.com/WriteSomeStuff/Libft.git
cd Libft/libft
make
```
You should see a libft.a file and some object files (.o).
